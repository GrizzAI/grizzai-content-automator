## 🚀 About the Project
The **GrizzAI Content Automator** is a one-page, browser-based tool that turns a single marketing idea into ready-to-post content for **multiple platforms at once** — LinkedIn, Instagram, X, Threads, and Facebook.

It uses the OpenAI API to apply **strict native formatting rules** for each platform — enforcing word limits, CTA styling, and smart hashtag sets — all within your browser.  
No backend, no frameworks, no dependencies. Just **pure HTML, CSS, and JS.**

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
✅ **Multi-Platform Generation** — produce posts for 5 platforms in one click  
✅ **Strict Format Rules** — enforces word count, CTA bolding, hashtags per platform  
✅ **Copy-Ready Cards** — each post has a “Copy” button for quick publishing  
✅ **Local API Key Storage** — your key is safely saved in the browser  
✅ **Responsive Dark UI** — gold + blue branding on black, “AI with Bite” theme  
✅ **Error Handling & Loader** — built-in rate limit message and smooth loading animation

## 🔐 Notes
- The OpenAI API key is stored in your browser’s `localStorage` for convenience.

- Add a `.nojekyll` file in the repo root (already recommended) to prevent build issues.
