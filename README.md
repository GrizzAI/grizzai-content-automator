## 🚀 About the Project
The **GrizzAI Content Automator** is a one-page, browser-based tool that turns a single marketing idea into ready-to-post content for **LinkedIn, Instagram, X, Threads, and Facebook**.

It uses the OpenAI API to apply **strict native formatting rules** for each platform — enforcing word limits, CTA bolding, and smart hashtag sets — all within your browser.

No frameworks. No backend. No dependencies.  
Just **pure HTML, CSS, and JS**, running locally or on **GitHub Pages** — powered by **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**.

GrizzAI is built for creators, freelancers, and small businesses who need *consistent, on-brand content — fast.*
