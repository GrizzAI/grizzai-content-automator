## 🚀 About the Project
The **GrizzAI Content Automator** is a one-page, browser-based tool that turns a single marketing idea into ready-to-post content for **multiple platforms at once** — LinkedIn, Instagram, X, Threads, and Facebook.

It uses the OpenAI API to apply **strict native formatting rules** for each platform — enforcing word limits, CTA styling, and smart hashtag sets — all within your browser.  
No backend, no frameworks, no dependencies. Just **pure HTML, CSS, and JS.**
