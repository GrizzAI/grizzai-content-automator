## 🚀 About the Project
The **GrizzAI Content Automator** turns one marketing idea into optimized posts for multiple platforms — all formatted to fit **LinkedIn, Instagram, X, Threads, and Facebook**.

No frameworks. No backend. Just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript running on GitHub Pages — powered by the **OpenAI API**.

GrizzAI is built for creators, freelancers, and small businesses who need *consistent, on-brand content* — fast.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages  
- **Brand Colors:** Gold `#f5c542` and Blue `#3aa7ff` on Black `#0b0b0f`

## 🚀 About the Project
The **GrizzAI Content Automator** is a one-page, browser-based tool that turns a single marketing idea into ready-to-post content for **multiple platforms at once** — LinkedIn, Instagram, X, Threads, and Facebook.

It uses the OpenAI API to apply **strict native formatting rules** for each platform — enforcing word limits, CTA styling, and smart hashtag sets — all within your browser.  
No backend, no frameworks, no dependencies. Just **pure HTML, CSS, and JS.**

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
✅ **Multi-Platform Generation** — produce posts for 5 platforms in one click  
✅ **Strict Format Rules** — enforces word count, CTA bolding, hashtags per platform  
✅ **Copy-Ready Cards** — each post has a “Copy” button for quick publishing  
✅ **Local API Key Storage** — your key is safely saved in the browser  
✅ **Responsive Dark UI** — gold + blue branding on black, “AI with Bite” theme  
✅ **Error Handling & Loader** — built-in rate limit message and smooth loading animation  

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Open the [live app](https://grizzai.github.io/grizzai-content-automator/).  
2. Fill out your **Core Idea**, **Audience**, and **Goal / CTA**.  
3. Select one or more **Platforms**.  
4. Choose your **Tone** (Bold, Professional, Casual, or Educational).  
5. Click **Generate Content** → watch AI-formatted posts appear instantly.  
6. Use **Copy** to grab each post with hashtags included.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI Chat Completions API (`gpt-4o-mini`)  
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages  

---

## 🔐 Notes
- The OpenAI API key is stored in your browser’s `localStorage` for convenience.  
- If you share the site publicly, use a small proxy to protect your API key.  
- Add a `.nojekyll` file in the repo root (already recommended) to prevent build issues.
